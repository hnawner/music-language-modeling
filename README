MODELS:
neural nets - all neural net models:
    combined - models that predict pitch AND rhythm:
        note - models that use note representation
            To run these models:
                python run_model.py
            Parameters must be set in run_model.py:
                model - model type: "RNN" "CRNN" or "DNN"
                train - folder of training mel files
                test - folder of final test mel files (or None for tuning)
                model_type - pitch and rhythm interact? - True/False
                transpose - Transpose melodies to common key?: True/False
        timestep - models that use timestep representation
            (still being developed)

    separate - models that predict pitch OR rhythm:
        dnn - deep neural network
            To run this model:
                python dnn_run.py
            Parameters must be set in dnn_run.py:
                train - folder of training mel files
                test - folder of final test mel files (or None for tuning)
                n - length of input in number of notes
                data_type - “pitch” or “rhythm”
                model_type - regularization type: “default” = no regularization
                                  “bn” = batch normalization and dropout
                                  “l2” = l2 regularization
                transpose - Transpose melodies to common key?: True/False
                encode - type of pitch encoding: “pc” = pitch class + octave
                                 “abs” = absolute chromatic pitch
        rnn - recurrent neural network
            To run this model:
                python rnn_run.py
            Parameters must be set in rnn_run.py:
                train - folder of training mel files
                test - folder of final test mel files (or None for tuning)
                n_neurons - number of neurons in each RNN layer
                data_type - “pitch” or “rhythm”

ngrams - all ngram baseline models:
    combined - pitch and rhythm combined baseline
        To run this model (unigram and bigram):
            python run_combined_tests.py [train folder] [test folder]
    
    pitch - pitch only baseline
        To run this model (pitch and interval unigram and bigram):
            python run_pitch_tests.py [train folder] [test folder]
    
    rhythm - rhtyhm only baseline
        To run this model (unigram and bigram):
            python run_rhythm_tests.py [train folder] [test folder] 
            
    time_steps - time step representation baseline
        (still being developed)
